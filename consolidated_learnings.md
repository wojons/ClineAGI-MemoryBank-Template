# Consolidated Learnings for ClineAGI

This file contains curated, summarized, and actionable insights distilled from the raw reflection log for the ClineAGI project.

## AI Prompt Analysis & Design
Insights from analyzing various AI system prompts provide effective patterns and guidelines for designing prompts and understanding different communication styles (empathetic, concise, adaptive, structured).

## Tool Usage Best Practices
Effective tool usage involves understanding specific tool scenarios, combining actions where appropriate, and robust error handling.

## Structured Planning & Reasoning
Methodologies like planning modes, working backwards, and simulated Chain-of-Thought are valuable for breaking down complex tasks and transparent reasoning.

## Process Execution Control
When performing sequences of actions, especially after interruptions, ensure controlled, step-by-step execution with explicit user confirmation before proceeding with each subsequent step to avoid perceived autonomous looping.

## Documentation & File Management
Ensure necessary files (like reflection logs) exist before attempting to write to them.
